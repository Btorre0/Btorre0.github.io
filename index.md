### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

   Lab 2, part 1, is one of my favorites because it was one of our first-ever labs. I first found it difficult to understand the concept of opening and pushing my code. After that lab, I felt more at ease as I understood the most basic concepts of Computer Science. In this lab, we had better the program. Meaning we had to fix the formatting, linting, and clone and push our repositories. But after this lab, I became familiar with formatting, pushing, and linting.

* Lab 5

   Lab 5, part 1, is also one of the interesting labs. It was the first time where we used arguments in our system. It was exciting. The thought of having the user interact with my program excited me. This program used the function 'cin' for the first time. Pulling out of this program, I learned how to use arguments within the terminal and the code. 

* Lab 12

   Lab 12, part 2, is one of my top favorite labs so far. In this lab, we needed to create a gif using private and public classes. Not only were we able to use the public and private classes, but we also used all of our knowledge from our previous labs to complete the lab, like Using loops, vectors, strings, etc. The lab was also straightforward, allowing us to understand what to write.
